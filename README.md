# Discrete logarithm in finite fields of small characteristic

Forked from Sagemath and containing experimental code for computing
discrete logarithm in finite fields of small characteristic.

The algorithms are due to Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux, and Thom√© and an
implementation is in `src/sage/rings/finite_rings` in the file
`BGJT.py`.
